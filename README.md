# Pack
(Pretty awesome Clojure kit)

## What's in it?

- Ring
- ClojureScript with Reagent
- [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com/)

## Why Inertia?

Inertia is the glue that connects your backend and frontend. It allows your app to use your backend routes and receive the data it needs which also includes an instruction of which React view to render.

This approach allow you to build an SPA without thinking about writing fetch requests. It uses the web as a platform and lets you focus on building your app.

## Special thanks

This repo is starting out as pretty much a copy of [prestancedesign's PingCRM clone](https://github.com/prestancedesign/pingcrm-clojure/) it also uses their [Inertia integration](https://github.com/prestancedesign/inertia-clojure/).

Without those two projects, this project wouldn't exist.
